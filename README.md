barnowl-zebra
=============

__barnowl-zebra__ converts the decodings of _any_ ambient RAIN RFID tags by Zebra readers supporting the Zebra IoT Connector (ex: FX9600) into standard developer-friendly JSON that is vendor/technology/application-agnostic.

![Overview of barnowl-zebra](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-zebra/images/overview.png)

__barnowl-zebra__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-zebra) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between.  It is included in reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite, and can just as easily be run standalone behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance, as detailed in the code examples below.
